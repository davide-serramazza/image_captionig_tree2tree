This is a modified version of the repository https://github.com/m-colombo/tf_tree to perform image captioning task as tree to tree transduction
The code is written using an old version of tensorflow, specifically the version 1.12
More informations about the usage of the code can be found in my thesis, which is contatined in this repository.
To prepare input and target for generic image captioning task, i.e. non structured data, the repository https://github.com/davide-serramazza/image_captionig_tree2tree_input-target_processing contains all the code used for this step
